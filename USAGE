Description:
    Creates a new controller and its endpoints. Pass the controller name
    under_scored, and a list of endpoints as arguments.

    This generates a controller file in app/controllers with unit test
    file. Finally, edits config/router.py in order to add controller to
    FastAPI router.

Example:
    `fastapi-mvc generate controller stock_market ticker buy:post sell:delete`

    Creates controller with URLs like /stock_market/ticker.
        Controller: app/controllers/stock_market.py
        Test:       tests/unit/app/controllers/test_stock_market.py
